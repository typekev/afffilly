## About <a name="about"></a>

Afffilly is **first and foremost an open source tool for supporting our favourite creators**. By automatically applying the affiliate codes you choose, the creators you want to support receive a commission when you shop online, as if you had clicked on their affiliate link for your purchase.

Second, Afffilly crowdsources and applies coupon codes to help you save money **without steal your data**. Your data stays on your device, and you stay in control.

If youâ€™d like, you may at any time explicitly share a _snapshot_ of your coupon data with the maintainers of Afffilly by opening the Afffilly extension settings menu, clicking the share coupon data button, and following the provided instructions.
